/**
 * CONTAINMENT OF A MALFORMED FRAME — note 87, item two.
 *
 * `handleLine` is the handler that exists to contain a bad line, and until 2026-10-04 one shape of
 * bad line walked straight past it: `null` is valid JSON, so it parsed cleanly and then threw a
 * TypeError on the first property read — `typeof msg.method` — which sat ABOVE the try. `connect`
 * fires `handleLine` with `void`, so that throw became an unhandled rejection, and an unhandled
 * rejection is a process fault under Node's default. One peer writing one junk line could take a
 * shipped plugin server down.
 *
 * WHAT IS PINNED HERE IS THE CONTAINMENT, not the wording: the promise RESOLVES, and a JSON-RPC
 * error frame goes out on stdout instead.
 *
 * THE TWIN. `starmind_dev/src/mcp/McpServer.ts` is a deliberate hand-maintained copy of the module
 * under test, and this defect was present in both. Both were fixed by hand, and the matching test
 * lives at `starmind_dev/src/__tests__/frame.test.ts`. Keep them in step by hand too — the whole
 * reason the copy exists is that the abstraction which would avoid it costs more than it saves.
